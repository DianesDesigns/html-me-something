<h3>Easiest plants to grow list</h3> <p>I love finding easy plants to grow, so here are the top easy vegetables which have thrived in my central IL area garden:</p>

<ol><li>sugar&nbsp;snap&nbsp;peas</li>
<li>mint</li>
<li>garlic</li><li>parsley</li>
</ol>

<p>I would love to grow so many garden veggies, but now that I am a Launch Coder, how can I do both?  I had to set aside having a big garden this year due to time constraints, but I would have loved to grow:</p>

<p><ol>
<li>Watermelons, small and large</li>
<li>cantelope</li>
<li>zucchini</li>
<li>bell peppers</li>
<li>corn</li>
<li>yard long beans</li>
</ol></p>
<p>Yummy!</p>


<p>If I am able to, and if they grow, I will have a few veggies in our family garden this year.  I was going for just tomatoes, but the list has grown a little bit.<ol>
<li>All kinds of tomatoes, especially cherry</li>
<li>carrots</li>
<li>lettuce blend</li>
<li>marigolds to pair with the tomatoes (maybe)</li>
<li>yard long beans</li>
</ol></p>
